# Sudoku-
This Project contains both a player and a solver. That is, you can play it, and if you feel like quitting, there is a separate file that solves the board. You can import your own board of whatever size you wish.  

The Computer Player is the board-solver which solves the board with the help of backtracking. Since it uses backtracking, it will print out all the possible solutions of a board.  
The .txt files are the boards. The bombs you see on mobile version of the game is represented by zeros here.
